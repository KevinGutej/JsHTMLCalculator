# Java Script Calculator

This file is just an exercise.

Thanks to this exercise I managed to practice my skills and get to know around **Javascript,EventListeners**:

- query selectors
- data-*
- event listeners
- functions
- const vs let keywords
- parsing variable types 
- logic operators
- string methods
- different conditional statements

Additionally I took advantage of the opportunity to use **CSS Grid Layout**.

## Known Bugs
- after performing an operation the calculator dosen't work intuitively; User has to delete everything after each operation
- 0 / 0 = NaN when it should be undefined
- Decimal expansions are too long
- Using innerHTML rather than innerText
